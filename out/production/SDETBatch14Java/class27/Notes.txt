ArrayList vs LinkedList:
    ArrayList and LinkedList both implement the list interface. But internal implementation is different. LinkedList
    is better for manipulation(adding new data at run time in-between or in the start of the list or removing
    data) of data. ArrayList is better when most of the time we use get method.
Sets:
    Sets are another set of datastructures in collections framework that allows us to store only unique data.
    As we can convert any data structure in collections framework, we can use sets to remove duplicate data from
    Lists we can also use sets.
Types of sets:
    There are many types of Sets, but we will be discussing only 1)HashSet 2)LinkedHashSet 3)TreeSet
HashSet:
    Upside: It is most memory efficient, and it requires less space as compared to other types of sets.
    Downside: HashSet does not maintain the insertion order.
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Order of the elements is maintained.
    Downside: It takes more memory, and it is slower than Hashset.
TreeSet:
    Upside: Data is sorted in natural order.
    Downside: It is slowest, and it takes more memory than Hashset.
Demos of storing the objects of a custom class
and how we can iterate through sets

Important interview question:
    What is a toString() method?
    toString method is used to print custom outputs whenever we try to print the object of a class println
    method internally calls this method. This method is inherited from the Object class. All the classes that we create
    in java automatically inherited from Object class.
