Collections Framework:
    Collections framework is collection of multiple classes and interfaces which help us process that data efficiently
    and easily.
Why we should learn about it when we already have arrays:
    1)It's very flexible.
    2)Provide ready-made methods that we can just use.
What is the Syntax?
    It's similar how we create the object of any class, but we use <> to specify the name of the class whose objects we
    are going to store in that class.
Issues with Collections framework:
    1)Collections framework does not work with primitive data types (solution is use wrapper classes).

    ****FREQUENTLY ASKED IN INTERVIEWS****

Wrapper Classes:
    Wrapper classes are object types for all primitive types.
Boxing:
    Converting the primitive data types to its corresponding wrapper type by explicitly calling methods.
    EXP:    int num=10;
            //Below note is called boxing or manual conversion from primitive to wrapper type:
            //Integer wrappedNum=Integer.valueOf(num);
Auto Boxing:
    Converting the primitive data types to its corresponding wrapper type by simply assigning the values.
            //Below is example of auto unboxing-automatic conversion of a wrapper type to a primitive type
            int num2=wrappedNum;
Unboxing:
    Converting a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive type by explicitly calling a method.
           //Unboxing is converting a wrapper type to a corresponding primitive type
           //int num2=wrappedNum.intValue();
Auto Unboxing:
    converting a wrapper to a corresponding primitive automatically by just assigning the value.
    Integer wrapperNum=new Integer(10);
    int num2=wrappedNum;
